Neural Information Processing project - Representation Similarity Analysis vs Performance

Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) is a method from neuroscience used to compare representations of different models. While it has been applied to neural networks before, there exists no comprehensive study on how representation as measured by RSA relates to performance. We relate model accuracy to RSA on FashionMNISTand ImageNet datasets. The term paper is uploaded as  rsa_vs_performance.pdf.

Provided are three scripts. RSA_on_FashionMNIST.ipynb performs RSA on FashionMNIST. It includes model training. Florian_and_Alex's_script.ipynb performs RSA on ImageNet. Here, pre-trained models are used. Yang's_scrips.ipynb contains visualizations.
